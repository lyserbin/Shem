# SharpStem
This project was first a try to port 'stem' (the tor control library), from python to .NET.<br/>
Then we decided to switch to do our own implementation of the control protocol.<br/>
It is written in C# using VisualStudio 2013, and the whole project is released under the GPLv3 license.<br/>
For more information about the license read the file 'LICENSE' in the root of this repository.<br/>
